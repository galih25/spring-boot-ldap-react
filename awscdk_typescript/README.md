# Spring Data LDAP React with AWS CDK 

AWS CDK is Amazon's IaC (Infrastructure as Code) offering and is an alternative to HashiCorp's Terraform.
CDK allows developers to use their programming language of choice rather than a DSL in Terraform (HCL).

This sample is written in TypeScript and the main application level additions are in lib/awscdk-stack.ts
